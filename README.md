A "simple shell" typically refers to a basic command-line interface or shell program that allows users to interact with an operating system by entering commands. Unlike full-featured shells like Bash or PowerShell, a simple shell may have limited functionality and may not support advanced features like scripting or extensive command history.

A simple shell program usually performs the following tasks:

1. Accepting user input: It waits for user input, typically in the form of text commands.

2. Parsing input: It processes the user's input to identify the command and its arguments.

3. Executing commands: It runs the specified command with the provided arguments.

4. Displaying output: It shows the results or output of the executed command.

5. Looping: It typically runs in a loop, repeatedly accepting and executing commands until the user decides to stop.
